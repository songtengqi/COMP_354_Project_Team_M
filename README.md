# Instructions

## Open the application

### Running from command line:
-	In the command line, navigate to folder: 
          `COMP_354_project_Team_M /Application/COMP_354_project_Team_M_jar`
-	Once you are in the folder, type in the command line: 
      `java -jar COMP_354_project_Team_M.jar`      

### Running from IDE:
-	Open package COMP_354_project_Team_M using your preferred IDE
-	Run class UI.java located in `src/eternity/math/UI.java`

## Use the software

From the Main Menu, type the option number you want and hit enter:
-	1 for Algebra calculator 
-	2 for Finance calculator (Mean Absolute Deviation and Standard Deviation) 
-	3 for Settings 
-	q to exit the program

### Algebra Calculator:
Algebra Calculator allows you to calculate algebraic equations.

- From the Algebra Calculator Menu, type the equation you want to evaluate and hit enter
-	Some examples of equations:
-	    1+2.5+pi
-	    sinh(1+2.5)
-	    sin(pi/2)
-	    2^(5+5) + e
-	    arccos(0.5) + 2^6
-	    log(2,8) + 3.4 + log(100)
    - log(2,8) for log base 2 of 8 
    - log(100) for log base 10 of 100



___Notes: Please make sure to put the variables inside brackets for these functions:___
- sin(), cos(), arcsin(), arccos(), sinh(), log(), sqrt()

### Finance Calculator:
Finance Calculator includes two statistical functions: Mean Absolute Deviation and Standard Deviation.

-	From the Finance Calculator menu, type the option number you want and hit enter:
    - 1 for Mean Absolute Deviation 
    - 2 for Standard Deviation 
-	To use the Mean Absolute Deviation or Standard Deviation calculators, enter the series of variables separated by a space, and hit enter
-	Some examples:
-     1 2 3.4 5 44
-     100 200 300 10 12
-     1.1 2.22 3.333
### Settings:
Settings option allows you to change the decimal places of ETERNITY or switch ETERNITY between Degree and Radian mode
-	From the Settings menu, type the option number you want and hit enter:
    - 1 for Decimals
    - 2 for Degree/Radian
- - - - 
### Notes:
At any point during the program, you can use the following options:
-	m to go back to previous menu
-	h to see history
-	c to clear history
-	q to quit the program
